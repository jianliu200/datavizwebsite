        <p>I am in Data Visualization (CSCE 447) because it is a crucial way to communicate information and data to people. 
            Over the summer when I was interning at a company, there was a strong emphasis on data visualization such as graphs, charts, and tables in order, so it was easier to understand the data. 
            It also helps create valuable insights from the data, allowing the company to make better decisions.
            Because of how important it is, I want to learn about it and how to create effective data visualization.

        <h5><a href = "https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p25-1144.pdf">An insightful visualization: The foreign-born population in the US from 1850 to 2010
            and the future projections to 2060. Page 9</a>
        </h5>
        <p>
            The chart is really helpful in showing not only the number of foreign-born people who lived in the US over the number of people, but also the percentage of foreign-born people in the US as well. With the chart, it is easy to read the chart as the number is on every bar or point and the years increase by 10. Furthermore, the scaling of everything is the same, so there is not any misleading information. 
           It helps to see the number of foreign-born people who have lived in the United States over the years. This can help people, like historians, with insights into historical events and how they correlate with the number of foreign-born people in the US. For example, in the late 1800s,
           there was an influx of immigrants that came into the US as there were job opportunities such as the famous Ellis Island. Although it does not show a lot of immigrants by number,
           by percentage, it was a historical high in the 1890s. But in the early 1900s, there was the Immigration Act of 1917 and 1924 that limited immigration to the United States, and over time, there was a decrease in the number of immigrants coming in. The chart can correlate the number of events in US history for foreign-born people and the effect that it has on the number of foreign-born people in the US.
           Furthermore, the chart shows the future projections of the number of foreign-born people in America and the percentage as part of the US population, which shows a trend that the amount of foreign-born people in the US will continue to grow.

        <h5><a href = "https://www.codeconquest.com/blog/12-bad-data-visualization-examples-explained/">Unhelpful visualization: Presidental Election vote percentage (Bad Data Visualization Example 8)</a></h5>
        <p>
            As you can see, the chart shows the presidential election results in Venezuela in 2013 between Nicolas Maduro Moros and Henrique Capriles Rawdonski.            
            It was a close voter vote percentage for both candidates, as Nicolas Maduro Moros had 50.66% and Henrique Capriles Rawdonski had 49.07%, making Nickolas Maduro Moros the president by a slim margin. However, this chart makes it seem like Moros beat Rawdonski by a large margin, as the bars were very small for Rawdonski and towering for Moros. 
            This can mislead people into thinking that Moros was the clear winner and most popular candidate in Venezuela.
